      <h1>Transportation</h1>
      <h2>Traveling to Sydney</h2>
<p>Many major airlines offer regular direct flights to Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport (SYD) from major cities in Asia and North America, with connecting flights to other destinations. The airport is located approximately 8 km south of Sydney’s CBD and the Camperdown/Darlington Campus.</p>
<p>The Sydney Train T8 line offers regular service subject to a surcharge from the International Airport Station to the Sydney CBD, where you can transfer to other trains, buses, metro, and light rail services across the city. Additionally, bus route 420 runs between Mascot and Burwood via the International Terminal. You can pay with either an Opal card, which is available at the International Airport Station, or a contactless debit/credit card.</p>
<p>You can also take a taxi or Uber to the Sydney CBD, which costs approximately AUD $45 and takes around 20 minutes, depending on demand and traffic conditions.</p>
      <h2>Getting around in Sydney</h2>
<p>The Sydney Nanoscience Hub (A31) is approximately a 30-minute walk from Central Station and a 20-minute walk from Redfern Station. Frequent bus services connect the university campus with the Sydney CBD. You can alight at <i>University of Sydney, City Rd</i> or <i>University of Sydney Ross St Gate</i> and walk to the Nanoscience Hub. Be sure to tap off when getting off.</p>
